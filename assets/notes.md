Starting is hard, sticking with something is hard. There is so much information out there about bug bounty hunting. It can be overwhelming. I am following Bugcrowd's Bug Bounty 101 run by InsiderPhD.

Week 1 Intro Bug Bounty 101

- learn some coding, cloud and deployment (CI/CD pipelines, AWS)
- more important is learning computational thinking (steps needed to carry out a task like making coffee)
- InsiderPhd used Burp community edition for 12 months

Homework
- how does the internet work
- what is a request, response 
- what is happening when your browser loads a website, how does it know what your display, how do the website know you have logged in and not someone else
